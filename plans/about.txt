I am a long time film visual effects veteran.  I started with computer graphics and programming when I was 12 and was lucky enough to grow up near NewTek, makers of Lightwave 3D and the video toaster.  Eventually I was hired as a technical director for Rhythm and Hues at 21, worked on Aslan for The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe at 23, took responsibility for Garfield at 24 (which was used downstream by over 100 people) and helped lead a team on A Night at the Museum later that year.  My last vfx job was as Lead Technical Director of Industrial Light and Magic Singapore.

For the past four years I have been working with C++11,  eventually starting my own S-Corp LLC to sell a Unity asset to do live light mapping, single handedly garnering near universal praise in comparison to the previous built in solution which was bought from ARM.


I am currently self employed and flexible since I work from home. My time goes into building and marketing my Unity App.
