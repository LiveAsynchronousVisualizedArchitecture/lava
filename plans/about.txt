Most of my career has been spent in film visual effects with my last job being Lead Technical Director of Industrial Light and Magic Singapore. I started programming and computer graphics when I was 12, was hired at Rhythm and Hues at 21, worked on Aslan for The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe at 23, took responsibility for Garfield at 24 (which was used downstream by over 100 people) and helped lead a team on A Night at the Museum later that year. After, I worked at Digital Domain and Rising Sun in Sydney before moving to Singapore to work at ILM.

For the past four years I have been working with C++11,  eventually starting my own S-Corp LLC to sell a Unity asset which does live feedback light mapping, garnering near universal praise in comparison to the previous built in solution, which was bought from ARM.

Two major indications that I can do this:
1. I've already created most or all the components in some form and used them in other projects.
2. The project is in progress and has already yielded what I feel are very useful components despite being done in my spare time.


I am currently self employed. I'm flexible since I work from home and have already launched multiple versions of my asset. My time currently goes into building and marketing my Unity App.
