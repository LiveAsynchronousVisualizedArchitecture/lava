With this I would be able to spend 6 weeks getting to a state where the node graph can be used productively, opening up the possibility of others being able to start doing research.   Multiple components could also stand alone as general purpose projects on github.  Hopefully extra promotion and attention would be brought to it as well, since it would be great to get more people involved.
