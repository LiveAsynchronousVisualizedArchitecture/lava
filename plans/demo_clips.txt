|  Create a message passing node that takes input from stdin
|  Create a gauss curve in a message passing node as an IdxVerts model
|  Show the "positions y" array in the brandisher, which should also show the gauss curve
|  Reshape the window and show the array window redrawing/fitting
|  Show the model in the visualizer

|  Create stub .exe with a .json file that makes it into a stand alone program? 
|  Create a .cpp file that has the connections hard coded and compile that?
