Gauss Curve
|  Create a message passing node that takes input from stdin
|  Create a gauss curve in a message passing node as an IdxVerts model
|  Show the "positions y" array in the brandisher, which should also show the gauss curve
|  Reshape the window and show the array window redrawing/fitting
|  Show the model in the visualizer


Stand Alone
|  Create stub .exe with a .json file that makes it into a stand alone program? 
|  Create a .cpp file that has the connections hard coded and compile that? 


Gauss Curve 2
|  Make a message passing node create the parameters
|  Use the command prompt node to fill in parameters
|  Make a node that fills in the parameters randomly


Ray Tracing
|  Make an obj loader node
|  Make a node to create an embree BVH
|  Make a node that creates large batches of rays
|  make a node that traces the rays with embree
|  make a node that runs a brdf on the rays and give another batch of rays
|  visualize the rays colored by the brdf with alpha of 0 so that they are additive
|  visualize the rays generated from the brdf
