Should data flow nodes have a separate function from the main that runs first?
 - Gives the number of allocations along with each of their sizes
 - Then one thread local allocation could be done
 - Would be difficult for larger nodes to give the maximum amount of memory needed if they had the potential to re-use memory.


Is scatter needed?
 - The real synchronization should come from data
 - Ordering can be done at any point by sorting on the version number
 - any list should be able to be 'scattered' and processed by different threads because the data is separate


Make message passing nodes circles and data flow containers squares
 | both could contain stats
 | the message passing nodes could have segments on the border that show their connections/messages to data flow containers and other message nodes
 | | use an arc along the border and change it to hav a teardrop shaped protrusion that transitions into the line/noodle showing the connection?
