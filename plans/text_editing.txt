color code for errors, warnings and static analyses
|  red for compiler errors and crashes
|  yellow for compiler warnings and detected memory leaks through the running node 
|  green for static analyses

color code for performance in performance visualization mode (node graph)
|  size nodes differently for performance?
|  gradient of red to yellow to green to blue
|  two metrics for performance:
|  |  time spent relative to the total time spent in the program
|  |  time spent relative to the amount of data that comes into it


if there is a timeline of text edits, can the edit that causes a compiler error be narrowed down? 
|  the timeline could be colored by whether it compiles or not at the time
