| High Level Todo List: |
-------------------------

simdb:
 | Concurrent Robin hood hashing
 | Resizing of block lists instead of full destruction and creation when changing the value of a key
 | Reference counting of the memory mapped file so that it can be deleted on the last program close in osx and linux
 | some sort of resizing

tbl:
 | templating instead of using int as a standing
 | tbl references as a value for the map
 | owned tbl values for the map through offset into the child tbl segment of the tbl memory  
 | flattening of tbl references into owned tbls 

visualizer:
 | take out nuklear and put in nanogui
 | frames per second
 | rgb under cursor 
 | text field or file dialog for database selection

node graph:
 | file saving as tbl
 | solidify node shared library format
 | output of lava_flow data


| Readme.md writeup
| lava_flow, data packet execution
| tbl visualization
| concurrent priority queue
