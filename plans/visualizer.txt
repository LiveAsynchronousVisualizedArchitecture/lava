dealing with multiple types:
|  have separate simdb file for the visualizer
|  have all data be a tbl
|  shouldn't be able to find any keys in other arbitrary data
|  have that tbl have a type field that is an unsigned 8 byte number 
|  IdxVerts would be geometry type
|  raw table would have type 'Table'



comparing multiple keys from the same type
|  IdxVerts can draw over each other in 3D space
|  Table could be made to interlace arrays and matching keys 
|  |  While displaying the field values side by side with different colors? 


switching between types
|  have tabs at the top to switch between types 
|  tabs have a number beside them that shows how many of each type there are?
|  color key buttons for their different types
|  will need to check each key to see if is a tbl or not
|  should tbl have a magic number for the first 16 bits? The first 8 bytes?
